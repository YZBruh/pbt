## Partition Manager (pmt)

This binary C is for manage partitions of android devices.
It offers a lot of options. I will place these below. But first let me talk about the operation...

#### Presented arguments (options)

```
Usage:  pmt backup PARTITION [OUTPUT] [OPTIONS]...
  or:   pmt flash PARTITION FILE [OPTIONS]...
  or:   pmt format PARTITION FILE_SYSTEM[ext/2/3/4] [OPTIONS]...

Options:
   -l, --logical     It is meant to determine whether the target partition is logical.
   -c, --context     It is meant to specify a custom /dev context. Only classic partitions (default: /dev/block/by-name).
   -p, --list        List partitions.
   -s, --silent      Information and warning messages are silenced in normal work.
   -f, --force       Force mode. Some things are ignored.
   -S, --set-lang    Set current language.
   -v, --version     See version.
       --help        See this help message.

Examples:
   pmt backup boot_a -c /dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name
   pmt flash /sdcard/twrp/boot.img boot_a -c /dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name

### How is it built?
Make or Android NDK is required to build.

##### Build with NDK
 - [Download Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads) and extract the NDK package.
 - Clone this repository. And get access to it.
```
git clone https://github.com/ShawkTeam/pmt -b 2.5.0
cd pmt
```
 - Set the NDK working directory variable.
```
make gen-ndk-makefiles
export NDK_PROJECT_PATH="${PWD}"
export APP_BUILD_SCRIPT="${PWD}/src/Android.mk"
export APP_APPLICATION_MK="${PWD}/src/Application.mk"
```
 - Go to the NDK directory and start the build
```
./ndk-build
```
 - The output files will be inside the `pmt` folder. Binaries are available in two architectures within the `libs` folder. `arm64-v8a` (64-bit) and `armeabi-v7a` (32-bit).

                          pmt                 pmt
```

##### Build with Makefiles

```
make
```
 - For the make installable debian package:

```
make deb <ARCH_NUM>

# Examples
make deb FOR_THIS=64
make deb FOR_THIS=32
```

### Notes
If you want to change something, take a look at the configuration. You can change him.
it is located in the `build/config` folder. His name is `env.mk`. I gave the information in the file. You can ask more.
